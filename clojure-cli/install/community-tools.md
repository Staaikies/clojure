[practicalli/clojure-deps-edn]({{ book.P9IClojureDepsEdn }}) provides a user wide configuration for Clojure CLI tools, providing a range of community tools to support Clojure and ClojureScript development.

Alias names are designed with qualified keywords which provides context for the use of an alias (`project`, `repl`, `env`, `test`, `inspect`). These keywords help with discovery and reduce cognitive load required to remember their purpose.

This configuration supports all your local development projects.  For remote environments or [Continuous Integration services](/continuous-integration/), include practicalli/clojure-deps-edn in the environment build or copy specific aliases to the project `deps.edn` configuration of a project.


## Install
Clojure CLI tools uses a configuration directory called `.clojure`, which [by default](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#_deps_edn_sources) is placed in the root of the operating system user account directory, e.g. `$HOME/.clojure`.

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` may be set by your operating system and over-rides the default location, e.g. `$HOME/.config/.clojure`

`CLJ_CONFIG` can be used to over-ride all other location settings

> Check the location of your Clojure configuration directory by running `clojure -Sdescribe` and checking the `:user-config` value.

Practicalli recommends creating a fork of the [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn]({{ book.P9IClojureDepsEdn }}) on GitHub, or you can simply clone the original repository.

Clone the repository to the configuration directory, e.g `~/.clojure/`.  If you have run the `clojure` or `clj` commands, then a default `deps.edn` file was created and should be moved or deleted first.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-fork/clojure-deps-edn.git ~/.clojure/
```

> #### Hint::clojure and clj commands create a configuration directory
> Running `clojure` or `clj` commands will create the `.clojure` configuration directory if it does not exist.  The .clojure directory should be removed before cloning the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn project.

All tools are provided via libraries and are only installed on first use.

If you choose to use your own `~/.clojure/deps.edn` then add an alias for the clj-new tool and rebel readline as this is extensively used in this guide.
