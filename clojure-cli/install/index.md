# Install Clojure and related tools

Clojure CLI tools provide a simple and configurable way to:

* Run Clojure programs and tools
* Run an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and evaluate Clojure expressions, usually with a [Clojure aware editor](/clojure-editors/)
* Managing dependencies (via tools.deps) from Maven and Git repositories

Using [community tools](community-tools.md) on top of Clojure CLI tools provides tasks to create, develop, build and deploy Clojure applications and services


## Complete Clojure development environment
Establish an effective Clojure development environment by installing the following:

| Tools                                         | Required    | Purpose                                                                                  |
|:----------------------------------------------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Java OpenJDK 17 LTS](java.md)                | Essential   | Java virtual machine host for Clojure. Java 17 is the current Long Term Support version  |
| [Clojure CLI](clojure-cli.md)                 | Essential   | Run Clojure services and start a REPL process                                            |
| [Community tools](community-tools.md)         | Recommended | Curated aliases providing common development tools for all Clojure CLI projects          |
| [Clojure aware editors](/clojure-editors/)    | Recommended | Editors supporting a Clojure development environment                                     |
| [Code analysis (clj-kondo)](code-analysis.md) | Recommended | Lint tool to detect syntax bugs and suggest idiomatic code                               |
| [Data browsers](data-browsers/)               | Recommend   | Visualize results of Clojure code, navigate nested data and page through large data sets |

> #### Hint::Aliases provided by practicalli/clojure-deps-edn
> [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](#clojure-cli-tools-common-aliases) provides a user wide configuration of over 30 aliases to support Clojure development.  These aliases use meaningful names to avoid clashes with project specific aliases, ensuring that the user wide aliases remain available in all projects.


## Alternative development tools

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) is a build automation tool for Clojure.  All code examples should work with Leiningen, given a correctly configured `project.clj` file with the required dependencies.
